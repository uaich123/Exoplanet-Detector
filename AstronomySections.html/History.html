    <h1>History of Astronomy</h1>
    <p>I'll start by saying that what we know about planets is much more ancient than the 20th century. 
        Honestly, astronomy could be one of the oldest, if not THE oldest profession in the world. At that time, 
        any one who looked up to see the celestial bodies such as the Sun and Moon could be considered as an 
        amateur astrononomer. 
    </p>
    <p>The first representations of celestial bodies were proposed during the time of the Neolithic period. These
        representations were heavily tied to religious beliefs, leading to the creations of multiple cosmogonies
        that tried to explain the structure of the universe.
