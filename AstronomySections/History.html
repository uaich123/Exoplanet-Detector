    <h1>History of Astronomy</h1>
    <p>I'll start by saying that what we know about planets is much more ancient than the 20th century. 
        Honestly, astronomy could be one of the oldest, if not THE oldest profession in the world. At that time, 
        any one who looked up to see the celestial bodies such as the Sun and Moon could be considered as an 
        amateur astrononomer. 
    </p>
    <p>The first representations of celestial bodies were proposed during the time of the Neolithic period, very often 
        just the sun and the moon. These representations were heavily tied to religious beliefs, leading to the creations of multiple cosmogonies
        that tried to explain the structure of the universe. 
    </p>

        <figcaption><strong>Figure 1</strong>: A not so good drawing by me representing the model shown by Milton</s></s></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The model above shows the representation of the model by John Milton(1608-1674) in his epic poem <em>Paradise Lost</em> representing the ancient religious
        beliefs of the universe. As the picture above shows, the world has four main parts: Heaven, Hell, the main world, 
        and chaos.</p>
    <p><strong>The main world</strong> is surrounded by <strong>chaos</strong>, and outside is <strong>heaven</strong> on the top and 
        <strong>hell</strong> on the bottom, linked to the main world by their respective gates as shown by the respective
        blue lines on the top and bottom of the inner circle

    </p>
    <p>There were multiple other theories like this, especially in India, but the astronomers were mainly interested
        in the motion: specifically, the motion of The Sun, the motion of The Moon, and the motion of The Stars.
    </p>
    <p>Some interesting obervations they noticed were that all the stars weren't always setting and rising at the same time during the day.
        Also, the height of the sun in the sky was dependent of the period of the year. Thus, as it's pretty obvious, something was happening here. And with the glorification of nature itself,
        that "something" was used in funeral rituals and for burials.

        <figcaption>Here is the alignment of Dolmans and stones in Carnac, a commune in Brittany, France!
            The direction of the alignment is put according to the motion of the Sun, spefically where it sets or 
            raises at a given time during the year.
        </figcaption>  
    </figure>
    <p>Like the example, above, which already dates back to several thousands of years before Christ, 
        there are even older examples with the same concept, such as the Tumulus of Tassili, or graves
        with corridors in Knowth, Ireland. 
    </p>
    <p>It wasn't just The Sun and The Moon! Turns out, early astrononomers noticed that there 
    were five other objects that were moving on the background of the fixed stars. Those objects were
    <strong>Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn(dubbed "the wandering stars" by the greek)</strong>, 
    also the five brightest planets in our solar system. These five stars brought a whole new field of discussion.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Unlike stars that are "fixed" or  The Sun which takes only one day to move through the sky, 
            these planets end up taking several months! For example, Venus takes 250 days and Mars takes 465 days to cross the sky.</li>
        <li>Evidenced by the above points, it's clear that these planets don't go at the same speed. Thus, there 
            motions are <strong>independent</strong></li>
        <li>If we follow these planets on the sky, we'll see that they reverse their motion at some poin for a temporary amount of time. So they go forward
            , go backwards for a bit, and finally continue going forward. These can be referred to as <strong>retrograde motions</strong>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <figure>
        <img src="../Images/MotionRetro.png" alt="Retrograde Motion Depiction">
        <figcaption>This is a picture and table showing a depiction of the <strong>retrograde motion</strong> that 
        temporarily causes the planet to move backwards before it moves forward again.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>With all this new info, the idea now was to develop a model that could explain The World at that time. And at that time, 
        The World was just Earth and what was moving around it, so really just very local in an astronomical sense. 
    </p>
    <p><strong>Now, the world is moving from a cosmogony to a cosmology.</strong> We want to understand how The Universe works. Why do we see these new motions?</p>
