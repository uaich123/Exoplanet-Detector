    <h1>History of Astronomy</h1>
    <p>I'll start by saying that what we know about planets is much more ancient than the 20th century. 
        Honestly, astronomy could be one of the oldest, if not THE oldest profession in the world. At that time, 
        any one who looked up to see the celestial bodies such as the Sun and Moon could be considered as an 
        amateur astrononomer. 
    </p>
    <p>The first representations of celestial bodies were proposed during the time of the Neolithic period. These
        representations were heavily tied to religious beliefs, leading to the creations of multiple cosmogonies
        that tried to explain the structure of the universe.

    <p>The model above shows the representation of the model by John Milton(1608-1674) in his epic poem <em>Paradise Lost</em> representing the ancient religious
        beliefs of the universe. As the picture above shows, the world has four main parts: Heaven, Hell, the main world, 
        and chaos.</p>
    <p><strong>The main world</strong> is surrounded by <strong>chaos</strong>, and outside is <strong>heaven</strong> on the top and 
        <strong>hell</strong> on the bottom, linked to the main world by their respective gates as shown by the respective
        blue lines on the top and bottom of the inner circle
